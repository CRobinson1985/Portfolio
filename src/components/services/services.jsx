            Frontend Development Fast, interactive sites using HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React. Whether itâ€™s a simple landing page or a
            complex UI, I bring your vision to life with smooth animations,
            clean code, and performance in mind.

            Website Refresh & Optimization Already have a site, but itâ€™s
            outdated, clunky, or slow? Iâ€™ll modernize it, improve speed and
            usability, and make it mobile-friendly â€” without starting from
            scratch.

            Collaborative Projects I work closely with a trusted team of
            developers, designers, and my creative partner Vale (branding +
            content), so you get the benefits of a full-stack studio â€” with the
            care and flexibility of a freelancer.

            Bilingual & International Need a site that speaks more than one
            language? I offer support for bilingual (English/Italian) content
            and international audience needs, perfect for tourism, education,
            and small businesses expanding globally.
